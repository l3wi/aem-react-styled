The watch task will watch files in the target folder of the ui.apps project and deploys
them in to AEM

all files in `ui.apps/target/classes/etc/designs/${appsFolderName}` and `ui
.apps/target/classes/apps/${appsFolderName}`. If a file is
changed then the folder is deployed to the running AEM instance via webdav.

All typescript files will also be watched and automatically transpiled and bundled into
two javascript files: `reactClient.js`  and `reactServer.js`.


This task will not detect changes in the src folder and hence you need to
copy files that you want automatically deployed into the target folder. This can be achieved
in eclipse by configuration of the build path for example.


Start the watch task which transpiles, bundles and uploads the javascript files to AEM.

Open console to folder /src/main/ts and run the watch task  `npm run watch`.

If your AEM instance is not running on localhost:4502 then you need to make these configurations:

````bash
npm config set demo:crx http://admin:admin@localhost:4502/crx/repository/crx.default
````
